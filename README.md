# GenomeBasedModel
This is the page for an R package GenomeBasedModel.
The package has been developed for estimating parameters of mathematical biological models and effects of genome-wide SNPs on the model parameters simultaneously by building prior distributions based on the SNPs for the parameters.

The latest version is 1.3.

tar.gz files are the source packages and .zip are the binary packages.

Instration can be done following the standard procedure for R package instration.
Rcpp and rrBLUP packages are required (the latter is for creating the genetic relationship matrix).
Rcpp and rrBLUP versions of the tested environment are 1.0.0 and 4.6, respectively.

Example scripts can be found in the documentations of the package.
