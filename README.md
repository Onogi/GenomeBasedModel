# GenomeBasedModel
This is the page for an R package GenomeBasedModel.
The package has been developed for estimating parameters of arbitrary biological statistical models and effects of genome-wide SNPs on the parameters simultaneously by building prior distributions based on the SNPs for the parameters.

Now the first version (GenomeBasedModel_1.0.tar.gz) is available.

Updates, examples, and source codes will be uploaded here.
An analysis example for rice growth model is included in HeadingDateModel.zip.
Another example for transcription dynamics of rice GIGANTEA is available at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/PTPGED.
